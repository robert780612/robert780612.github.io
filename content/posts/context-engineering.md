## Introduction

LLM (Large Language Model) agents are AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. 

Atomic prompts are short, simple instructions or questions given to the LLM to elicit specific responses. They help in guiding the model's behavior and improving the relevance of the generated content. However, it is essential to provide adequate context for the prompts to ensure the LLM generates accurate and meaningful responses.
